# automate_tomcat
Shellscript to automate installation, update checks and updates of Tomcat

This is a bash script to automate tomcat

  * (de)installation
  * update checks (to use e.g. via cron)
  * upgrades
 
I wrote this a while ago for a customer using a RHEL 8 installation. Unfortunately Red Hat decided
not to ship Tomcat anymore. The bash script uses RHEL 7 tomcat directories but maybe reconfigured
to use any dirs. It does not yet make use of SELinux ACLs yet. For reference the RHEL 7 Tomcat ACLs
are included.

## Usage
```
myprompt|% ./automate_tomcat.sh 

 Syntax:

    ./automate_tomcat.sh  <OPTION>

  where OPTION is one of

          --help    what you are loooking at
          --check   checks the latest already downloaded version against the one available from Apache
                    (return code 11 means: you're running an old version)
          --update  you have a working installation previously generated by this script and you want to
                    update the installation. Config files won't get overwritten
          --init    bare Tomcat installation from Apache web site. Adds a tomcat user/group if not available.
                    After this need to supply the webapp and edit config files
          --force   force installation, all files will NOT be overwritten
          --remove  ATTENTION: dangerous: it wipes the whole tomcat installation off the disk
                    and removes any added tomcat user/group.

Using a terminal the default is to get status info what the program is doing. When you use
--check in a cronjob, and if you're behind the actual release a notification will be sent
to the specified (cron) mail recipient.


Use it at your own risk. Usage without any warranty. It's recommended to backup
your files before usage.
